#### Profile
Hi, my name is James. I am originally from sunny Southend-on-Sea (questionable) in Essex and I am a prospective coder/web developer, hoping to some day get into Fintech! ðŸ˜Ž

Along with the web development course, I am currently studying towards an MPhil in European, Latin American and Comparative Literatures and Cultures at the University of Cambridge.

My interests include:

- Football (Homerton College Fourths and Arsenal fan)
- Fitness (gym 4 days a week )
- Reading (second-hand book shopping to fuel the addiction)
- Nature (I am an amphibian surveyor in my spare time!)

#### About  
This file contains all my reading notes from class 102 and 201.


#### Growth Mindset  
> A growth mindet is all about changing the habit of describing oneself in terms of failure. Rather, one should be receptive to challenges that foster the growth of intellegence and talent.  

Reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:
1. Be patient (getting to the level of others in Fintech will be an uphill battle, but one that I am fully committed to! ðŸ’ª)
2. Accept that mistakes are part of the learning process 
3. Celebrate growth
