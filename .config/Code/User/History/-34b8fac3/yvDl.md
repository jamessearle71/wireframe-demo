### Structure Web Pages with HTML Reflection

Hyper Text Markup Language is a language used to structure web pages. It allows users to implement headers, paragraphs,images, links, etc., into their websites. The three main parts of an HTML element include opening tags, content and end tags. The metadata tag as well as the alt tag can be used to add information to a site that isn't necessarily readable to people visiting the site but boots SEO and accessibility. A semanic element is a tag that describes their function in a way that is readable.
