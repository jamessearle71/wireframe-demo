# Learning Markdown
Markdown is a markup language that can be used as a formatting tool in plaintext documents. As opposed to WYSIWYG applications such as MS Word, Markdown does not contain buttons that allow you to format text. Rather, Markdown is a syntax that indicates how text should appear. For instance, adding a # symbol before a word or phrase converts that piece of text into the largest heading. In terms of headings specifically, users can add up to 6 # symbols, the higher number representing the smallest heading. Personally, I think Markdown is more accessible than HTML in terms of readability, since the lines of code are not as busy. Markdown is appropriate for a number of purposes, such as creating websites and documents, writing notes or conducting emails. It is also supported by numerous desktop and web-based applications and runs on any OS.

In terms of syntax, another common symbol is the asterisks (*). Users can wrap a word or phrase in a single set of asterisks in order to italicise or double asterisks to make that word or phrase bold. For instance, * hello, my name is James * / ** hello, my name is James ** (spaces for illustrative purposes only; they must be removed to achieve the desired effect). Links can be inserted by enclosing your metada within square brackets and then pasting the link between parentheses. Note: there should not be a space between these two elements. Unordered lists can be created by adding a dash, asterisk or a plus sign to the beginning of the line of code.
